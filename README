====== Coupled Cluster for Solids ======

===== Module dependencies =====

To initialize the modules just run
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

Then compile each module

==== CTF ====

To build ctf
  cd modules/ctf/
  ./configure CXX=mpixxx
  make -j 8

where ''mpixxx'' is the employed mpi compiler.

==== Update to newer module versions ====

If any of the submodules are updated by their respective maintainer, you
incorporate the latest version into cc4s.  Note that this may lead to
incompatibilities.  Run all tests before you commit the changes.

The modules can be updated by running:

  git submodule foreach git pull origin master
  # RUN TESTS
  git commit -m "Updated submodules to latest version"
  git push origin master

===== Building =====
  * Setup the ''config.mk'' file for your build environment.
  * ''config.mk.gcc'' and ''config.mk.icc'' contain templates for gcc and icc, respectively.
  * run ''make -j 8'' to build (in parallel for some speed)
  * run ''make install'' to copy the executable to the specified target directory. The default is ''~/bin/cc4s''.

===== Running =====
  * operation file, e.g. ''mp2.cc4s'', can be run with ''~/bin/cc4s/Cc4s -file mp2.cc4s -logLevel 2''.
