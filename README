====== Coupled Cluster for Solids ======

===== Module dependencies =====

To initialize the modules just run
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

Then compile each module

==== CTF ====

To build ctf for a specific configuration ''xxx'' (see below)
  cd modules/ctf/
  mkdir build/xxx -p
  cd build/xxx
  ../../configure CXX=mpixxx
  make -j 8

where ''mpixxx'' is the employed mpi compiler.

==== Update to newer module versions ====

If any of the submodules are updated by their respective maintainer, you
incorporate the latest version into cc4s.  Note that this may lead to
incompatibilities.  Run all tests before you commit the changes.

The modules can be updated by running:

  git submodule foreach git pull origin master
  # RUN TESTS
  git commit -m "Updated submodules to latest version"
  git push origin master

===== Building =====
  * Write a ''config.xxx'' file for your build environment ''xxx''.
  * The configuration files ''config.gxx'' and ''config.icc'' contain predifined retail environments for gxx and icc, respectively, using full optimization and without debugging info.
  * Note that the location of the CTF library may differ from environment to environment.
  * make sure, ctf is built for your configuration
  * run ''make -j 8 CONFIG=xxx'' to build for the environment ''xxx'', by default for ''icc''. The ''-j'' option issues a parallel make on 8 processes.
  * run ''make install CONFIG=xxx'' to copy the executable to the specified target directory. The default is ''~/bin/xxx/cc4s''.
  * The intermediate build files for each build environment can be found in the directory ''build/xxx/''

===== Running =====
  * operation file, e.g. ''mp2.cc4s'', can be run with ''~/bin/cc4s/Cc4s -file mp2.cc4s -logLevel 2''.
