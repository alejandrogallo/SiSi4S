  cd modules/ctf/
  ./configure CXX=mpixxx
  make -j 8

===== Building =====
  * Setup the ''config.mk'' file for your build environment.
  * ''config.mk.gcc'' and ''config.mk.icc'' contain templates for gcc and icc, respectively.
  * run ''make -j 8'' to build (in parallel for some speed)
  * run ''make install'' to copy the executable to the specified target directory. The default is ''~/bin/cc4s''.
