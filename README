====== Coupled Cluster for Solids ======

===== Building =====
  * Write a ''config.xxx'' file for your build environment ''xxx''.
  * The configuration files ''config.gcc'' and ''config.icc'' contain predifined retail environments for gcc and icc, respectively, using full optimization and without debugging info.
  * Note that the location of the CTF library may differ from environment to environment.
  * run ''make -j 8 CONFIG=xxx'' to build for the environment ''xxx'', by default for ''icc''. The ''-j'' option issues a parallel make on 8 processes.
  * run ''make install CONFIG=xxx'' to copy the executable to the specified target directory. The default is ''~/bin/xxx/cc4s''.
  * The intermediate build files for each build environment can be found in the directory ''build/xxx/''

===== Running =====
  * operation file, e.g. ''mp2.cc4s'', can be run with ''~/bin/cc4s/Cc4s -file mp2.cc4s -logLevel 2''.
